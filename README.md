# UE_Space_Partioner_Using_TOctree
## Synopsis
This is a simple space partitioning algorithm using the TOctree type. It is designed to be general enough to allow users to customize it to their liking. 

## Motivation
This project was created to give users an easy to access reference on how to use the TOctree type in their own Unreal Engine projects. We are using TOctree in this project for space partioning, but it can be used for a wide variety of purposes.

##Installation
The project is availible in its entirety. All a user has to do is clone the repository to his or her computer. When opening the Visual Studio solution, make sure that "Development Editor" and "Win64" are set in the configuration manager drop downs at the top of the editor window.
